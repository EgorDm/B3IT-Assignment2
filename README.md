# B3IT-Assignment2
Assignment includes making a device which can recognize hand gestures and resond to these gestures by watering the plants or performing actions to refresh de sensor data. 

### [Report](https://github.com/EgorDm/B3IT-Assignment2/raw/master/paper/paper.pdf)
Checkout report for more in detail about the functioning of the hand segmentation and gesture recognition methods.

Forgive me for some grammar mistakes since it was written in a hurry ;)


## Usage
* Use CMake to build main target which is the server to run the gesture recognition
* Use platformio to build the arduino client which handles the sensor and actuator data
