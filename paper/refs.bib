abstract="Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) exists ubiquitously in our daily lives. It is usually achieved by using a physical controller such as a mouse, keyboard or touch screen. It hinders Natural User Interface (NUI) as there is a strong barrier between the user and computer. There are various hand tracking systems available on the market, but they are complex and expensive. In this paper, we present the design and development of a robust marker-less hand/finger tracking and gesture recognition system using low-cost hardware. We propose a simple but efficient method that allows robust and fast hand tracking despite complex background and motion blur. Our system is able to translate the detected hands or gestures into different functional inputs and interfaces with other applications via several methods. It enables intuitive HCI and interactive motion gaming. We also developed sample applications that can utilize the inputs from the hand tracking system. Our results show that an intuitive HCI and motion gaming system can be achieved with minimum hardware requirements.",

abstract="The existence of large image datasets such as the set of photos on the World Wide Web make it possible to build powerful generic models for low-level image attributes like color using simple histogram learning techniques. We describe the construction of color models for skin and non-skin classes from a dataset of nearly 1 billion labelled pixels. These classes exhibit a surprising degree of separability which we exploit by building a skin pixel detector achieving a detection rate of 80{\%} with 8.5{\%} false positives. We compare the performance of histogram and mixture models in skin detection and find histogram models to be superior in accuracy and computational cost. Using aggregate features computed from the skin pixel detector we build a surprisingly effective detector for naked people. Our results suggest that color can be a more powerful cue for detecting people in unconstrained imagery than was previously suspected. We believe this work is the most comprehensive and detailed exploration of skin color models to date.",
